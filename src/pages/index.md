## Welcome to the Swindon Film Society

The [Swindon Film Society](/about-sfs/sfs-origins/) was established in 1947. In all this time, we have been showing, at the Swindon Arts Centre, the best films that international cinema has to offer. The SFS is a [membership](/membership) club, regulated by [Cinema For All](http://cinemaforall.org.uk/) (trading name for the British Federation of Film Societies).

As a society, it is required that our films are shown to society members and their guests. Please help us by joining today.

Our members' guests may purchase their [individual admission to films](/membership) at the Swindon Central Library, the Wyvern Box Office or directly at the door of the Arts Centre on film nights.
