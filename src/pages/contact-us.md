If you want to join SFS or find out about membership, please click for the [Membership page](/membership). Or you can just turn up on a film night, and join before the show.

Although we do have a close relationship with Swindon Arts Centre, we are not part of it. We are a small organisation run by a committee of volunteers. We pay a hire fee to the Arts Centre to show our films.
