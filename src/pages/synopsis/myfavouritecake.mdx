The Iranian government has not supported the film, banning Moghaddam and Sanaeeha from travelling to Berlin for its premiere, and accusing the film-makers of ‘crossing several red lines’, by depicting Mahin drinking alcohol and without her hijab.
What’s even more subversive, however, is Mahin’s sense of agency.  Moghaddam and Sanaeeha frequently depict her alone at the centre of the frame, whether enjoying an affogato in a posh hotel lobby, waiting for a cab outside the market, or sitting at a park bench overlooking the city.  In each setting, Mahin’s independence is presented as a fact rather than pitied.

Too often, later-in-life romances are presented as ‘cute’, neutered, shorn of desire; however, here that desire is suggested, rather than shown.  A scene in which the couple take a shower fully clothed risks reading as twee but in the event is simply tender, as they vulnerably acknowledge their long bouts of celibacy.  There’s sensuality to be found elsewhere anyway, in Mahin’s night-blooming jasmine, and the promise of an orange blossom cake.

Peter Bradshaw says that as well as everything else, this wonderfully sweet and funny film will contribute to the debate about whether repressive regimes are the nursery of artistic greatness.

He praises the performance of the lead pair and concludes his review by saying that there is something quietly magnificent in it as moments like these in life are poignantly brief – but many never have them at all
