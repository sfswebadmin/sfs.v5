"The Perfect Candidate is a simple story, told without frills or even much in the way of nuance...",
"The Saudi Arabia it shows us is a place where modernity rubs up against entrenched conservatism, and where even the most decadent Barbie Princess-inspired wedding still features a singer who croons, 'There is no God but Allah' ...",
"The Perfect Candidate suggests that all it might take is for one bright, bold individual to put their shoulder to the wheel for the direction of travel to be altered, if only by a degree."

... The Perfect Candidate is a testament to change as well as portraying that change in progress.  Nothing in the film is as radical as its lightness of touch, its warm good humour and its sense of optimism ...
