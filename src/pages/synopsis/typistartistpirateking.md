... The finished work gives a sense of what it might have been like to spend time in Amiss’s company: it is warm, funny, chaotic, and a little frustrating. Cantankerous Audrey hoodwinks her frazzled care-worker Sandra – a woman who has never driven on the motorway – into chauffeuring her the 300-odd miles to Sunderland in a tiny yellow Nissan Leaf via A-roads and country lanes, setting the stage for a scrappy and occasionally surreal road movie …

… Beautifully lit and shot by DoP Agnès Godard, the film is as much a love song to Amiss as to the North of England. Here is Anthony Gormley’s Angel of the North; here the windswept beaches of Roker and Seaburn. ... Lingering shots take in Amiss’s paintings and sketches, as well as the scrapbooks of sweet wrappers that constituted her ‘avant-garde phase’.

... It’s up to the viewers to discern if Audrey has staunch memories or elusive fabrications, in the way that an art gallery might challenge perception and thinking. From the moment the audience is introduced to Audrey’s flat and frantic daily routines, they’re invited to be challenged. Not only are ideas surrounding mental health and the care available for it confronted head-on, but the meandering and often chaotic pacing of the film is an acquired taste – like a bemused mother wandering around an avant-garde installation, pretending to know what she’s talking about. ...
