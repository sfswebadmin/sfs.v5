Martin and three close friends embark on a reckless experiment: to see if daytime drinking can help them become better versions of themselves – to learn to live again.

Vinterberg paints a sardonic portrait of a society torn between well-mannered mediocrity and “going completely bonkers” – a trait (along with sarcasm) that he believes the Danes share with the Brits ... Another Round reminds us of the unique blend of anarchic energy and technical precision that has defined Vinterberg’s best works.  It’s a brilliantly ambiguous affair, woozy but precise, profound yet playful, confronting matters of life and death with equal vigour, while ultimately raising a toast to the redemptive power of cinema.

Made by Hollywood, this would have been a comedy.  But in the hands of brilliant Danish director Thomas Vinterberg, it's a more subtle tragedy and revelation.  Mikkelsen is perhaps best known as a Bond villain, television's Hannibal Lecter, and in a new role as Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts series.

But Another Round is a performance on another level.  Unspoken agony hovers beneath the surface.  Tears well up instead of joy during a caviar and champagne dinner, and the silence of Martin’s long marriage to Anika (Maria Bonnevie) feels like a shroud.  Alcohol liberates — and also detonates.

### Film Facts

* Another Round is dedicated to Ida, Vinterberg’s 19-year-old daughter, who died in a car crash just as production began and was due to take a small role in the film.  The film was partially filmed in her classroom with her classmates.
* The film won an Oscar for Best International Feature Film and two BAFTAs for Best Film Not in the English Language and Best Leading Actor.
* Denmark has some of the highest rates of teenage drinking in the world; a World Health Organisation report released earlier in 2020 found that Danish 15-year-olds consumed alcohol at nearly double the European average.
