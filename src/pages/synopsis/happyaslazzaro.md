synopsis: "On an estate called Inviolata, isolated since 1977, 54 farmhands work on a tobacco farm in a share-cropping arrangement, where they are constantly in debt and thus unpaid.  The farm is run in a feudal manner by the notorious Marchioness Alfonsina De Luna, the 'Queen of Cigarettes'.  Lazzaro, an innocent young man, is a worker on the farm, helping the farmhands with their endless work…"

This is the tale of a meeting between Lazzaro, a young peasant so good that he is often mistaken for being simple-minded, and Tancredi, a young nobleman cursed by his imagination.

Life in their isolated pastoral village Inviolata is dominated by the terrible Marchesa Alfonsina de Luna, the ‘Queen of Cigarettes’.

A loyal bond is sealed when Tancredi asks Lazzaro to help him orchestrate his own kidnapping. This strange, improbable alliance is a revelation for Lazzaro - a friendship so precious that it will travel in time and transport Lazzaro in search of Tancredi. In the big city for the first time, Lazzaro is like a fragment of the past lost in the modern world. A tale (or fable?) of social commentary set in rural Italy with touches of anti-capitalism and class division, where share-croppers live, without knowing their semi-slavery state because of lack of knowledge. Lazzaro the protagonist, is an innocent character who is happy to make others happy, in the pureness of his heart.

Various notes
</div>

Nothing much makes sense in Happy as Lazzaro, until a stunning mid-film pivot that shakes time and space and snaps it all together, its world emerging from the disturbance as senseless again — but in a completely different, all too recognisable way.

The third and most richly strange feature yet from Italian writer-director Alice Rohrwacher, this beautifully rendered movie sees her pushing her recurring fascination with fables to its most literal (and literate) degree. Earthy folkloric storytelling, time-travelling, magical realism and fact-inspired social drama are fused in its tale of a rural innocent defying life’s certainties to bear witness to two separate eras of social and economic exploitation. The result is a slow but bewitching burn that rewards viewers’ patience with humour and uncanny grace, sealing Rohrwacher’s status.
