Part of Chung’s film has the gentle, hazy energy of a memory – set in the Eighties, it draws partially from his own childhood experiences. Lachlan Milne’s cinematography is drenched in golden rays, Emile Mosseri’s score twinkles like stars, and the narrative often focuses on Jacob and Monica’s endearing but mischievous son David (Alan Kim, who is impossible not to love). 

When his parents fight, he and his older sister Anne (Noel Kate Cho, who's more passive, but absorbs everything like a sponge) make paper airplanes scribbled with the words “Don’t fight!” and propel them into the air. Their white neighbours are shown in a fairly generous light. Their racism is limited to the odd ignorant comment and intrusive question.

With liberal use of the expansive mid-western skies and gauzy afternoon sun, Chung conjures something elemental and sweeping from this tapestry of small moments.  

Minari takes his own experiences as a boy growing up in Arkansas and forges something almost Malickian from them (think The Tree of Life without the dinosaurs and intellectual grandeur) as it explores our link to, and responsibilities for, the land and each other.  It’s at once intimate and expansive – a film with a big heart and not a bad word to say about anyone.
