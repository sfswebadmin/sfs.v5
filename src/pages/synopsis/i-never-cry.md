But when her father dies while working in Ireland, and her mother is forced to stay behind with her disabled brother, it is Olka who must travel there to bring his body home.  Armed with only a backpack and a dwindling pack of cigarettes, she arrives in Dublin to seek out information about her largely unknown father and battle the various layers of bureaucracy that stand in her way."

Piotr Domalewski’s second feature is a powerful, thought-provoking film.  It turns a traditional genre trope on its head whilst raising little-discussed issues that affect millions of people.

I Never Cry is told from the point of view of a child of an economic migrant.  Olka (an extraordinary debut by Zofia Stafiej) is specialising in being a difficult teenager.  She is especially angry at her father who has been absent for half her lifetime because he works in Ireland.  When the father dies in an accident, 17-year -old Olka is dispatched to Dublin to get the body.

Olka … felt abandoned by her father without really considering why he left or what his life in a strange country was like.  So many Irish families have been parted by economic migration yet sometimes it seems we forget.  This film explores the economic migrant experience from both sides, those who leave and those who are left behind.  It is never mawkish, sometimes funny, always interesting.

Written and directed by multi award-winning film-maker Piotr Domalewski, I Never Cry is a bittersweet, dark comedy that draws heavily upon the inter-personal dramas of Ken Loach such as Sorry I Missed You or I, Daniel Blake.  On one hand, the feature is a slyly humorous coming-of-age tale about an adolescent gradually revaluating her outlook on life.  

On the other, it’s a moving portrait about the hardships faced by emigrants and their families back home.  Though the premise may sound like two ideas competing for attention, much of the picture’s success lies within the writer-director’s ability to blend these two ideas together in a way that’s natural and organic.  Through doing so, he’s able to isolate the human components of this story and dissect them when needed.
