The entirety of the 20th century — its promises, illusions and traumas — sweeps through the audacious and thrilling Martin Eden.  An ingenious adaptation of the Jack London novel, the film follows its title character, a humble young man as he embarks on a program of self-improvement.  Martin strives to change and advance and succeeds.  But his rags-to-riches path with its hard work, perseverance and bourgeois education, proves far more complicated and finally more shattering than most upward-mobility fairy tales…

The story opens when Martin, a sailor, is still rough clay.  He’s a beautiful and raw masculine specimen…

Marcello’s boldest conceptual move is to blur the story’s historical timeline, which he does through brilliant editing, archival footage and playing with the usual period cues.  Historical forces swirl and churn, ebbing and flowing as Martin continues on his quest for self-improvement.

The terrible loneliness of success is the subject of this absorbing movie, equal in some strange way to the loneliness of failure; it’s also about the secret and shameful feeling that failure is the one truthful state of being, which the successful person has had to renounce.

Martin Eden is also about capitalism and enterprise and the great 20th-century promise that hard work and an audacious gamble on a certain career path at the start of one’s life can carry anyone, however lowly born, on to riches.

And more importantly, it is about the dizzying promise that the mass communication made possible by commerce will make art itself lucrative: that actually writing novels, capturing the imagination of millions, could exalt you to heroic celebrity.
