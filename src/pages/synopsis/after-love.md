The debut feature from English-Pakistani film-maker Aleem Khan is a tale of secrets and lies, a portrait of people caught between identities and cultures.  

At its heart is a constrained yet wonderfully expressive performance by the versatile Joanna Scanlan, here offering a masterclass in the dramatic power of understatement ... English, French and Urdu are spoken, but it’s notable just how much Scanlan says without words, her eyes telegraphing earth-shaking revelations even as her lips remain sealed.  

By contrast, Richard speaks and gestures freely, while Ariss does a remarkable job of capturing both the anger (in one shocking scene, he spits in his mother’s face) and the anguish of a young man torn between his parents, his sexuality, his home.

As the crow flies, only about 30 miles separate the port towns of Dover and Calais — a distance that, in many parts of the world, wouldn’t span any greater culture shift than a slight tweak in accent.  

When those miles are filled with the English Channel, however, opposite coastlines represent opposite worlds, where everything from language to sexual mores are poles apart.  It’s a short but jolting journey, an exercise in social and geographic disorientation that British-Pakistani filmmaker Aleem Khan probes to layered, thoughtful effect in his auspicious first feature ‘After Love.’
