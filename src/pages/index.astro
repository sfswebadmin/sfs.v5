                <p>
                    Swindon Film has been at the heart of entertainment in Old Town for more than 75 years!  
                    Every year we show the best and widest variety of films that international cinema has to offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Swindon Film is a membership organisation. However, guests are welcome to come along, buy tickets on 
                    the door, and enjoy our films at highly competitive prices.  Membership provides even lower ticket 
                    prices plus other benefits.
