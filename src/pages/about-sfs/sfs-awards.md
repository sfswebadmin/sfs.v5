# Swindon Film Society Awards

Each year the British Federation of Film Societies holds its own awards ceremony for Film Society of the Year. The awards are an important BFFS tradition which help showcase the important work that community cinemas do while rewarding dedicated volunteers.

SFS has been successful in winning a number of awards over the years, including, in 2011 the coveted Engholm Prize for Film Society of the Year.
