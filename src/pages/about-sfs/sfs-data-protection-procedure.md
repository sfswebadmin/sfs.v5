# Data Protection Procedure

## Introduction

In order to operate, Swindon Film Society needs to gather, store and use certain forms of
information about its members.

This procedure explains how this data should be collected, stored and used in order to:

* Protect the rights of our members
* Comply with data protection law and good practice
* Protect the Society and its members from the risks of a data breach

## Roles and responsibilities
This procedure ​applies to all those handling data on behalf of Swindon Film Society.
Everyone who has access to data as part of Swindon Film Society has a responsibility to
ensure that they adhere to this procedure.
It applies to all data that Swindon Film Society holds relating to individuals:

* Names
* Email addresses
* Postal addresses
* The type of membership held (full/general) and when membership was last
renewed.

## Data controller

The Data Controller for Swindon Film Society is the Society’s Committee. It is responsible
for why data is collected and how it will be used. Any questions relating to the collection or
use of data should be directed to the Data Controller. This may be done by contacting any
member of the Committee, or emailing contact@swindonfilm.org.uk.

## Data protection principles

1. __We fairly and lawfully process personal data__
Swindon Film Society will only collect data with consent, where lawful and where it is
necessary for the legitimate purposes of the Society.
    * __Active Members:__
Personal data on current active members is collected and used to send information about
the Swindon Film Society Programme by email and by post, and to facilitate the
administration of the Society.
    * __In-active Members:__
On ceasing active membership members’ details will remain on the Swindon Film Society
records and mailing list for three years before being removed and erased. During
this period inactive members will receive information about the Swindon Film
Society Programme by email and post.
At any time active or inactive members may unsubscribe from Swindon Film Society mailings
and/or request that their details are removed and erased from Swindon Film Society
records.
2. __We only collect and use personal data for specified and lawful purposes.__
When collecting data, Swindon Film Society will always explain to the individual why the
data is required and what it will be used for. We will never use data for any purpose other
than that stated or that is reasonably related to it. For example, we will never pass on
personal data to 3rd
 parties without the explicit consent of the individual.
3. __We ensure any data collected is relevant and not excessive__
Swindon Film Society will not collect or store more data than the minimum information
required for its intended purpose.
4. __We ensure data is accurate and up-to-date__
Swindon Film Society will ask members to inform us of any changes to their personal data,
e.g. change of address or email. Any individual will be able to update their data at any point
by contacting the Data Controller.
5. __We ensure data is not kept longer than necessary__
Swindon Film Society will keep data on individuals for no longer than three years after their
last membership season, unless there is a legal requirement to keep records.
6. __We process data in accordance with individuals’ rights__
The following requests can be made in writing to the Data Controller by anyone whose data
we hold:
    * A person can request to see any data which is stored about them. Any such request
    will be actioned within 14 days of the request being made;
    * They can request that any inaccurate data held on them is updated. Any such
    request will be actioned within 14 days of the request being made;
    * They can request to stop receiving any communications from Swindon Film Society.
    Any such request will be actioned within 14 days of the request being made.
7. __We keep personal data secure__
Swindon Film Society will ensure that data held by us is kept secure.
    * Electronically-held data will be held within a password-protected and secure
    environment;
    * Physically-held data (e.g. membership forms or email sign-up sheets) will be stored
    securely;
    * Access to data will only be given to committee members where it is clearly necessary
    for the running of the group.
8. __Transfer to countries outside the EEA__
Swindon Film Society will not transfer data to countries outside the European Economic
Area (EEA), unless the country has adequate protection for the individual (e.g. USA).
