# Swindon Film Society Organisation

## About Us


Swindon Film has been at the heart of entertainment in Old Town for more than 75 years! Every year we show the best and widest variety of films that international cinema has to offer.

Swindon Film is a membership organisation. However, guests are welcome to come along, buy tickets on the door, and enjoy our films at highly competitive prices. Membership provides even lower ticket prices plus other benefits.

We are members of the national charity ‘[Cinema for All](https://cinemaforall.org.uk/)’ that supports and develops community cinema across the country.

Explore our website to find out about the films we are showing this year and learn more about how to [become a member](/membership). This is your chance to enjoy the world’s most interesting films, many of which are never shown at mainstream cinemas.

The Swindon Film Society is an independent voluntary organisation, run by a committee elected each year at the Annual General Meeting (held usually in October/November). We would always welcome new committee members who want to get actively involved in running the society.

The committee meets about once a month or less throughout the year. If you are interested in joining the committee, or would like the help in some way, please speak to any member of our team on a film night, or use the [Contact Us](/contact-us) page of this website..

## Our Season

Our season runs from September to April of the following year. Our main programme of 14 to 15 films is shown at the Swindon Arts Centre, using their digital projector, which has been available since 2008. The Arts Centre was also equipped with a new screen in 2016.Films are usually shown on alternate Wednesday evenings, depending on availability in the Arts Centre schedule.

Film notes, including synopsis and reviews, are provided at each performance; these are also available on this website. The audience can record its reaction to a film by indicating a response on a reaction slip handed to everyone attending a film performance. We display previous audience reactions on film nights.

We constantly search for new films, from one season to the next. If you like to see a recent film that might not be shown anywhere else locally, please feel free to make a suggestion to any member of our team.

## Our Equipment

In 2005 we were awarded an 80% grant from the UK Film council to purchase DVD equipment, with the aim of bringing all kinds of films to the wider community in the Swindon area. In early 2006 we started a new season of films in Highworth, and an ‘alternative’ programme at the Moose Hall in Swindon.

The Highworth venture went from strength to strength and has ultimately led to becoming a separate Film Society (see our Community Cinema page for details).

We have also used and are continuing to use our digital equipment in other locations. This DVD equipment has enabled us to engage in ‘Community Cinema’ and bring films to a wider audience beyond Swindon Arts Centre.

## Cinema for All

Swindon Film Society is a member of Cinema for All (formerly known as the British Federation of Film Societies or BFFS). Founder members of The British Federation of Film Societies included Anthony Asquith, Sidney Bernstein, Ivor Montagu, H G Wells, George Bernard Shaw, Augustus John and Maynard Keynes.

Cinema for All continues to be instrumental, through its many branches all over the country, in bringing good films to the general public without slavishly adhering to the yardstick of commercial success. In the final analysis, quality gives better and longer lasting enjoyment.
